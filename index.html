            <h2>Day 1 (Optimal matrix chain multiplication)</h2>
            <p>Because I know pretty well the Hanoi tower problem, I started with <a href="https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/day-2-matrix-chain-multiplication-3ae6349c34ab">Day 2</a>.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_chain_multiplication">Matrix chain multiplication</a> problem is a quite straightforward example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">Dynamic programming</a>.</p>
            <p>I implemented the basic algorithm. Wikipedia also points to a better algorithm, which I only skimmed over since it's quite complex and well beyond what I'm doing here.</p>
            <p>It took me:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>thinking: 2m</li>
                    <li>coding: 17m</li>
                    <li>debugging: 9m</li>
                    <li>total: 28m</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In future I think I can limit debugging greatly since I made some noob mistakes which required quite a bit of looking around the code to fix, but the coding went smooth and I didn't search the documentation that much.</p>
            <p>You can find the code in the <a href="https://github.com/radustoenescu/zombie-dev">usual place</a>. Nothing fancy. Maybe the <code>@functools.lru_cache</code> decorator is quite nice to check out since it makes memoization a lot easier to add.</p>

            <h2>Day 2 (Counting set bits)</h2>
            <p>Given an <code>int</code>, how many ones are there in its binary representation.</p>
            <p>For example: <code>0b00101</code> -&gt; 2; <code>0b001011101</code> -&gt; 5. You got the idea, easy peasy.</p>
            <pre data-language="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">count_bits</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">count</span></pre>
            <p>It works, but what the hell man?! That's kids stuff.</p>
            <p>Right, of course you can do better than that:</p>
            <pre data-language="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">count_bits_wicked</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&amp;=</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">count</span></pre>
            <p><em>What?</em></p>
            <p>Yeah, that's what I thought when I first saw that. I hate bit twiddling. I personally think it cripples the mind of any sane person.</p>
            <p>However, this one above is pretty easy to grasp and understand if you try it on a piece of paper.</p>
            <p>Here, of course I did that for you:</p>
            <img src="img/wicked_bits.jpg" />
            <p><em>Rumour has it that every horizontal line is a bitwise and between the current n and n-1. Except from the shortest one(second to last) which is a typo.</em></p>
            <p>So you can see how every and operation essentially knocks out one set bit at a time(<em>or one one</em>, if you prefer that).</p>
            <p>Thus, the complexity is <code>Theta(bits_set)</code> as opposed to my solution which went through all the bits every time, yielding <code>Theta(bits)</code> in complexity.</p>
            <p>This second solution is not mine. On this <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#CountBitsSetKernighan">bit porn</a> site you can learn more about it, and also find more bit twiddling porn if you're into that.</p>
            <p><em>No times for this problem since the naive solution took me nothing, and the smart one is not mine.</em></p>

            <h2>Day 3 (The Sieve of Eratosthenes)</h2>
            <p><strong>SPOILER ALERT: BOY ... IT WAS FUN!</strong></p>
            <p>This belongs to <a href="https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/day-5-eratosthenes-sieve-60ab162a1f5b">day 5</a> in the original series.</p>
            <p>Ok, this is a pretty simple algorithm, I remember implementing it for the first time in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Liceul-Teoretic-Alexandru-Ghica-Alexandria-830767510327046/">highschool</a> in Pascal. What makes it simple is that, usually, people implement the, let's call it, <em>bounded Sieve</em> - which generates all the primes up to a limit, and, if the limit is reasonable one can store the whole table in memory, and that's that - you just delete things from it, or mark things as non-prime.</p>
            <p>Having said this, if you want to generate primes infinitely(<em>given a certain memory or time budget</em>), the problem gets more interesting - <em>this one I implemented in college, in Scheme, or at least I thought so :)), but I'll stop with the spoilers now.</em></p>
            <p>Well, my idea (the one I implemented in college) is to start with an infinite generator containing all natural numbers above 1. At each step you pop one out and filter out its multiples from the generator. Easy-peasy, right?!</p>
            <p>So, I came out with this Python3 code:</p>
            <pre data-language="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">itertools</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sieve</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c"># begin with all natural numbers above 1</span>
    <span class="n">picker</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">itertools</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># take the next available number</span>
        <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">next</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">picker</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">v</span>
        <span class="c"># filter from the generator its multiples</span>
        <span class="n">picker</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">picker</span><span class="p">)</span></pre>
            <p>Aaand it didn't work.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I had no frickin' clue why it didn't. I could see some weird behavior in the debugger - the generator's contents were wrong - but I didn't knew why.</p>
            <p>I got a little paranoid, and started doubting I knew the solution, so I double checked by quickly implementing it in Haskell:</p>
            <pre data-language="haskell"><span class="nf">sieve</span> <span class="n">remaining</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">nextItem</span> <span class="kt">:</span> <span class="n">sieve</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filter</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">\</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="n">nextItem</span> <span class="o">/=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">remaining</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kr">where</span>
    <span class="n">nextItem</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">head</span> <span class="n">remaining</span></pre>
            <p>And that one worked. Now I was really puzzled since the Python code was a mere translation of the one in Haskell, I thought maybe I don't understand the inner workings of infinite generators in Python and the <code>filter</code> method</p>
