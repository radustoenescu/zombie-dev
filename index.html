        <h1>Zombie Dev Log</h1>
        <p><strong>Me:</strong></p>
        <p><em>A while back I died, as a developer.</em></p>
        <p>This was a long process. <em>A quite fun one, though.</em></p>
        <p>Everything started in 2014 when I joined the networking research lab of my college.</p>
        <p><strong>You:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Forget the college, tell us more about the death.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Me:</strong></p>
        <p>It was <strong>research</strong>, man. Research killed me ...as a developer (don't forget that, it might become important).</p>
        <p><strong>You</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Me</strong></p>
