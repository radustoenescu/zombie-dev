            <h2>Day 1 (Optimal matrix chain multiplication)</h2>
            <p>Because I know pretty well the Hanoi tower problem, I started with <a href="https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/day-2-matrix-chain-multiplication-3ae6349c34ab">Day 2</a>.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_chain_multiplication">Matrix chain multiplication</a> problem is a quite straightforward example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">Dynamic programming</a>.</p>
            <p>I implemented the basic algorithm. Wikipedia also points to a better algorithm, which I only skimmed over since it's quite complex and well beyond what I'm doing here.</p>
            <p>It took me:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>thinking: 2m</li>
                    <li>coding: 17m</li>
                    <li>debugging: 9m</li>
                    <li>total: 28m</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In future I think I can limit debugging greatly since I made some noob mistakes which required quite a bit of looking around the code to fix, but the coding went smooth and I didn't search the documentation that much.</p>
            <p>You can find the code in the <a href="https://github.com/radustoenescu/zombie-dev">usual place</a>. Nothing fancy. Maybe the <code>@functools.lru_cache</code> decorator is quite nice to check out since it makes memoization a lot easier to add.</p>
